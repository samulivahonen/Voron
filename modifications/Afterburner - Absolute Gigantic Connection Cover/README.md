# Afterburner - Absolute Gigantic Connection Cover

## Design

Copied the skrew holes and few other details from Voron standard, and then added lots of extra room to top and little to left side above the Afterburner. Added also small optional rear "door" to push the wires into the cover if they tend to push out.

Design can be found from OnShape online CAD: [link to CAD "file"](https://github.com/VoronDesign/Voron-Afterburner/tree/master/STLs/Gantry/Printheads)
